# Audacity - Extentions

### Audacity

Audicity is an open source application for recording and manipulating digital audio files. It utilizes the
Nyquist sound synthesis language developed at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/music.software.html).
Details are available on the Audacity and CMU sites.

### EZTracker

This is a popular digital audio recording application that many applications would do well to emulate:
it does one function very simply with no unnecessary frills.

## EZ-T Plug-in for Audacity

This is a small plug-in that can be dropped into Audacity that provides much of the functionality
that is available in EZ-Tracker. Just download the [plug-in file](EZTracker.ny) and drop it in the `plug-ins` folder
under the Audacity installation folder.

A more complete
<a href="https://github.com/jhshoun/Audacity/raw/master/Audacity_Install.pdf">user guide</a> 
is available that describes the installation in more detail along
with how the plug-in works.

Feel free to use and distribute. Let me know if you have problems or if you have suggestions for improvement.
